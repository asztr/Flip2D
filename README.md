# 2D FLIP Simulation
2D simulation of an incompressible and inviscid fluid, based on the _Fluid Implicit Particle_ (FLIP) method<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. The code implements an Eulerian approach over a Marker-and-Cell (MAC) grid to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In order to keep track of the air-liquid surface, the method uses a level set representation of the interface.
