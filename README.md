# 2D FLIP Simulation
2D simulation of an incompressible and inviscid fluid, based on the _Fluid Implicit Particle_ (FLIP) method<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup>. The code implements an Eulerian approach over a Marker-and-Cell (MAC) grid to solve the [incompressible Navier-Stokes equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations#Incompressible_flow):

$$ \frac{\partial\vec{u}}{\partial t} + \vec{u}\cdot\nabla\vec{u} + \frac{1}{\rho}\nabla{p} = \vec{g} + \nu\nabla\cdot\nabla\vec{u} $$

$$ \nabla\cdot\vec{u} = 0 $$

To solve these equations, the code uses an Eulerian approach over a 2D MAC (Marker and Cell) grid. The intermediate values of the physical magnitudes are obtained by either bilinear or Catmull-Rom interpolation.

### Level Set
In order to keep track of the air-liquid surface, the code implements a [level set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_set) representation of the interface. The interface is implicitly described by means of a function $\psi(\vec{r})$. Its value is defined in the cell centers along the grid as the signed distance to the interfaceâ€™s closest point. Thus, the interface is defined as the set of points where $\psi(\vec{r}) = 0$. The time evolution of the surface results from the simple advection of the function $\psi$ in the velocity field.

$$ \displaystyle \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t} = -\vec{u}\cdot\nabla\psi $$
